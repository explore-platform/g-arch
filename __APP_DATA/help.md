G-Arch integrates spectral analysis procedures that have been developed through the years to analyse Gaia/RVS data and ground-based spectra from different international projects. 

It is based on the MatisseGauguin algorithm ([Recio-Blanco](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...674A..29R/abstract) et al. 2023, Sect. 6 and references therein).
